The Cafe sample emulates a simple operation of the Coffee shop when modeled using
Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP).
It is inspired by one of the samples featured in Gregor Hohpe's Ramblings.
The domain is that of a Cafe, and the basic flow is depicted in the following diagram:


                                                                                       Barista

                    orders                   drinks               /              | prepareHotDrink()  |\  preparedDrinks

                                                                  \ coldDrinks   | prepareColdDrink() |/
                                                                   |==========|->|                    |
                                                                                 |____________________|

- The Order object may contain multiple OrderItems.
- Once the order is placed, a Splitter will break the composite order message into a single message per drink.
- Each of these is then processed by a Router that determines whether the drink is hot or cold
  8checking the OrderItem object's 'isIced' property).
- The Barista prepares each drink, but hot and cold drink preparation are handled by two distinct
  methods : 'prepareHotDrink' And 'prepareColdDrink'.
- The prepared drinks are then sent to the Waiter where they are aggregated into a Delivery object.

Instructions for running the CafeDemo sample
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The example comes with two identical configurations. One is ANNOTATION-based anther is XML-based

2. To run this sample simply execute the CafeDemo* test classes
   in the org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.xml or  
   org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation package.
   
   You should see the output similar to this:

INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-1 prepared cold drink #1 for order #1: iced 3 shot MOCHA
INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-1 prepared cold drink #2 for order #2: iced 3 shot MOCHA
INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-1 prepared cold drink #3 for order #3: iced 3 shot MOCHA
INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-1 prepared cold drink #4 for order #4: iced 3 shot MOCHA
INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-2 prepared hot drink #1 for order #1: hot 2 shot LATTE
-----------------------
Order #1
Iced MOCHA, 3 shots.
Hot LATTE, 2 shots.

INFO : org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.annotation.Barista - task-scheduler-2 prepared hot drink #2 for order #2: hot 2 shot LATTE
-----------------------
Order #2
Iced MOCHA, 3 shots.
Hot LATTE, 2 shots.
