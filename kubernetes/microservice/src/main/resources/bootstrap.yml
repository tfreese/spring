# The bootstrap.yml is typically used for the following:
#
# - when using Spring Cloud Config Server, you should specify spring.application.name and spring.cloud.config.server.git.repository
# - some encryption/decryption information
#
# Technically, bootstrap.yml is loaded by a parent Spring ApplicationContext.
# That parent ApplicationContext is loaded before the one that uses application.yml.

spring:
    application:
        name: myApplication
#  cloud.:
#    config:
#        server:
#            git:
#                repository: http://localhost:8123/
